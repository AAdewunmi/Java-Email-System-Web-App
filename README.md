## 3. Installation:

> I mistakenly created a web project instead of a maven web project, so this project will only 
display the landing page if you clone and run. It will not send or receive emails.
To get email to work, create a maven web project, then add the files in the repo and 
dependencies to your project. Have fun. ðŸ˜Ž
